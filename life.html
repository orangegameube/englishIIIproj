            <h3 class="smallerHead">Early Life</h3>
            <p>Serj Tankian was born in Beirut, Lebanon on August 21, 1967. During the Lebanese Civil War, he and his family moved to Los Angeles,
                California, where he resided in an Armenian-American community in the suburbs. He attended the Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian
                School, and attended California State University, Northridge during his college years. Throughout his early life, he was very
                active in protests and civil justice, first working with the Armenian Youth Federation and later becoming the president of
                Northridge's Armenian Student Association.
            </p>
            <h3 class="smallerHead">Rise to Fame</h3>
            <p>Tankian formed the band System of a Down alongside 2 former bandmates and another drummer, beginning their career with the album
                "Sugar" and touring throughout California's smaller venues. They hit it big when they released their second album Toxicity, which
                reached #1 on the Billboard 200 charts, helping propel them to worldwide fame. System continued to release albums, but band activity
                came to a standstill when Tankian and the band's guitarist Daron Malakian could not compromise on the creative and financial direction
                of the band. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="smallerHead">Later Career</h3>
            <p>With the band on an undefined hiatus, Tankian went on to further his career in music and activism through songwriting and producing.
                He has released multiple solo albums, as well as worked on soundtracks and music for various productions. Through his solo career, he
                has worked tirelessly to fight for social justice. For example, he co-founded the non-profit organization <i>Axis of Justice</i> 
                with Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine to help those involved with music group together with activist organizations to further
                human rights and peace.
            </p>
            <h3 class='smallerHead'>Activism for Armenia</h3>
            <p>As a proud Armenian-American, Tankian has worked for years to promote recognition of the Armenian Genocide, the massacre of about
                1.5 Armenian people in the Ottoman Empire during the early 20th century. He assisted in getting the United States of America to
                officially recognize the genocide back in 2019 through the passing of two resolutions. After hearing of new war between Armenia
                and Azerbaijan over territory, Tankian and System got back together to release the songs <i>Genocidal Humanoidz</i> and 
                <i>Protect the Land</i> to both raise money for Armenia and awareness for the issue.
